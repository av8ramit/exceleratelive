            <br><br>
            <h2 style = "color: #FF8C00">Tip 1: Pre-test Preparation.</h2>
            <p style = "color: #348cb2; font-weight: bold">Take at least one full practice test the week before your SAT. It will help you understand how to pace yourself, build your concentration endurance, and keep you relaxed for the real test. Make sure you are capable of finishing each section within the time allotted. Remember that guessing incorrectly will reduce your score so make sure you can narrow down your options to at most 3.</p>
            <br>

            <h2 style = "color: #FF8C00">Tip 2: Avoiding the experimental section.</h2>
            <p style = "color: #348cb2; font-weight: bold">Did you know there is a way to avoid the experimental section? When two sections of the same type occur back to back one of them is guaranteed to be an experimental section. Compare that one with the ones you have seen before or see in the future and you can deduce which section is experimental. Beware: Use this tip at your own risk!</p>
            <br>

            <h2 style = "color: #FF8C00">Tip 3: Monitoring the top Reading questions.</h2><br>
            <img src="{% static 'dashboard/css/images/reading_graph.png' %}"></img>
            <p style = "color: #348cb2; font-weight: bold">In the above graph above you will find the most common reading questions that are found in the SAT. As you can see the most popular types direct comprehension in the reading comprehension sections and the context single word replacement in the writing section. It would be more time efficient to focus on these questions as they are more common. Refer to your advanced report for more information about these questions.</p>

            <h2 style = "color: #FF8C00">Tip 4: Monitoring the top Writing questions.</h2><br>
            <img src="{% static 'dashboard/css/images/writing_graph.png' %}"></img>
            <p style = "color: #348cb2; font-weight: bold">In the above graph above you will find the most common writing questions that are found in the SAT. As you can see the most popular types are clauses and prepositional phrases as well as analogous phrases. It would be more time efficient to focus on these questions as they are more common. Refer to your advanced report for more information about these questions.</p>

            <p style = "color: #348cb2; font-weight: bold">In the above graph above you will find the most common math questions that are found in the SAT. As you can see the most popular math question types are solving basic algebraic sections and word problems. It would be more time efficient to focus on these questions as they are more common. Refer to your advanced report for more information about these questions.</p>
